\section{Conclusion}

Characterizing colored Petri nets categorically will allow them to be fit into the larger program of applied category theory. In particular, we conjecture that using the structured cospan construction \cite{StructuredCospans}, we can create a compositional framework for open colored Petri nets. These would be colored Petri nets which are equipped with a boundary on their inputs and outputs. One advantage of this would be a categorical description of the reachability problem for colored Petri nets as shown in \cite{OpenPetriNets}.
